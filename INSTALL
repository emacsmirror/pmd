;;; Commentary:
;; Installation:
;;  1) Install the core PMD application (not part of this download, get it 
;;     from http://pmd.sourceforge.net/);
;;  2) Make sure the directory of pmd.el is part of your Emacs load-path;
;;     E.g., copy file pmd.el to ~/.emacs.d/lisp
;;     and add this line to you .emacs file:
;;          (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
;;  3) Add the following lines to your .emacs file:
;; 	    (autoload 'pmd-current-buffer "pmd" "PMD Mode" t)
;; 	    (autoload 'pmd-current-dir "pmd" "PMD Mode" t)
;;  4) Load pmd.el:
;; 	    M-x load-library <RET>
;; 	    pmd <RET>
;;  5) Configure the location of the Java executable and the PMD installation 
;;     directory using the command pmd-customize:
;; 	    M-x pmd-customize <RET>
;;
;; 	Once this is done, you can call the pmd-current-buffer and pmd-current-dir 
;;  functions using M-x <function name> or by bind them to key sequences.

;; Configuration:
;; 	Besides the variables described above, you can also compile the rulesets used by PMD.
;;  Type:
;; 	    M-x pmd-customize
;; 		--or--
;; 	    M-x customize-group <RET>
;; 	    pmd <RET>
	
;; Description:
;; 	This mode uses a compilation buffer to display the output of PMD
;; (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/).  
;; It provides two commands, pmd-current-buffer and pmd-current-dir, which as you
;; guessed run PMD on the contents of the current buffer (must be a .java file)
;; or on all .java files in the directory associated with the current buffer. 
;; You can defining the PMD rulesets by customizing the variable pmd-ruleset-list.
