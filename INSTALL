;;; Commentary:
;; Installation:
;; 	add this line to your .emacs file:
;; 	    (autoload 'pmd-current-buffer "pmd" "PMD Mode" t)
;; 	once this is done, you can call the pmd-current-buffer function
;; 	using C-x or bind it to a key sequence.

;;   NOTE: This requies the xml parser in xml.el.  This is distributed
;; 	with the standard Gnu Emacs 21.x release. 

;; Configuration:
;; 	Most user variables can be customized through standard
;; 	customization buffers.  Type:
;; 	    M-x pmd-customize
;; 		--or--
;; 	    M-x customize-group <RET>
;; 	    pmd <RET>
	
;; Description:
;; 	This mode is similar to the compilation buffer found in the
;; 	JDE.  When you run pmd-current-buffer on a .java file, it runs
;; 	the PMD tool (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/) on the file with
;; 	the rulesets defined in pmd-rulesets.
	
;; 	Type ? in the *PMD* buffer for a list of key bindings for
;; 	pmd-mode and usage help.
