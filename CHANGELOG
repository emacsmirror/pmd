Checked in alternate plugin thx to Jason Rumney.

Completely rewritten by John Russell.

6/6/02 - 0.1:
First version of PMD for Emacs

Defined one function "pmd-current-buffer" which will
run PMD on the current buffer, and write the output
to *PMD*

Output format is in XML.  I will work in trying to 
get a better, easier to read format for everyone.

Share and Enjoy!
